Hey, team! I’ve been going over the project description. We are focusing on the impacts and perceptions of climate change, and we’re using three different datasets: one on hurricane data, another on ice extend and a dataset about global climate change awareness. What do you think about the structure so far?
Yeah, I was thinking the same. I think for the intro, we should definitely give some context on climate change first like environmental issue.
I was thinking of keeping the abstract short too. And once it’s cleaned up, we'll merge the datasets and do the exploratory analysis.
Ok then let's do it first
